# Simulations around Moire Lenses

In this code I replicate some results found in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.21.006955).
Also, you will find a simulation of the longitudinal intensity profile of two Moire lens and you'll be able to rotate one with respect to the other and choose the distance between them.
## Features

- [x] Profile phase plate simulation
- [x] Longitudinal intensity simulation


## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
